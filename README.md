# AnotherPhotoManager
# Coding Challenge

## Objective

Create a mobile app that manages a collection of online photos

## User Stories

- As a user I want to use the app in the latest version of iOS / Android
- As a user I want to navigate through my photo library in an interesting and intuitive manner
- As a user I want to be able to download photos from the cloud

## Technical Requirements

- The application *MUST* be a native application
- You *MUST* use Objective-C / Swift (iOS) or Java (Android)
- You *MUST* use git for version control
- You *MUST* show use of MVC or equivalent pattern
- You *MUST* demonstrate use of networking APIs
- Bonus points
    - Use creative, unique, and imaginative methods for displaying photos
    - Use of caching techniques to improved network performance
    - Use concurrency to improve user responsiveness

You MAY use any publicly available 3rd party libraries or frameworks that you choose, but be prepared to rationalize your choices

## Web API

Demonstrate use of a web API to retrieve images from the network. You can use the following, or another of your choosing.

## Tips

Use as much time as you feel is necessary, but remember this is only a challenge :)
- Deadlines mean that cutting corners is a necessary part of development. Cut the right corners and be prepared to defend your choices.
- You will be judged on the quality, readability, and structure of your code (in that order)
- You will be judged on *communicating* the architecture and the code structure of your app
